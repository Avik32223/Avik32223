Hey there! 👋

I'm a fullstack developer at [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/) building internal Tools for Builds, Testing, Deployment, Orchestration, Reporting and managing a lot of services ☁️.

### Seeking ideas and guidance: ✨ 
>>> I know a few things about Frontend, API Development, Distributed systems but I have a lot to learn yet. 
I am certain there are still so many things I don't know that I don't know.

### Goals for 2020. 🎯
  Pick up the habit of reading books and learn a new language. I plan to grok through a lot of technical articles and implement a few things. 
  Things that are on top of my list right now
  - [ ] Write more blogposts
  - [x] Leader election
  - [x] Replicated Database
